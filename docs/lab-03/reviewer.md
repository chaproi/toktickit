## 3. Review Checklist

The future reviewer should verify:

- [ ] The six docs/lab-03 contract files exist before implementation work is approved.
- [ ] Scope includes every mandatory Lab 3 capability and none of the excluded features.
- [ ] Authentication decisions cover Argon2id, secure credential/session storage, expiry, logout invalidation, login throttling, CSRF, and safe errors.
- [ ] Every protected API operation appears in the authorization matrix and is enforced by the backend plan.
- [ ] Requester identity comes only from the authenticated session.
- [ ] Queue query, assignment, IT Priority, status transitions, Comments, Notes, and resolution indication agree across all documents.
- [ ] Administrator rules cover one role, duplicate email, self-deactivation/self-role protection, last active Administrator, non-terminal owner conflicts, terminal historical ownership, no deletion, and new initial password behavior.
- [ ] Migration preserves Development Requester ids, immutable historical requester references, Ticket ownership, Attachment relationships, statuses, and priorities while validating unique per-User initial credentials before mutation.
- [ ] Every AC maps to at least one Planned test and no test is prematurely marked Pass.
- [ ] UI states, responsive widths, accessibility, and Zen Green rules are complete.
- [ ] API request/response shapes, statuses, validation limits, conflicts, and safe failures are internally consistent.
- [ ] Product Definition of Done is testable and does not claim future evidence.

| Date | Reviewer | Location | Finding | Response / Commit | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-09-18 | Chxtamos | PR #26 requested-changes review, Blocker 1 | Migrated Lab 2 statuses, ownerId=null, and the owner invariant were contradictory. | Added the complete seven-status table, null-owner migration/postflight policy, unassigned Queue/Claim behavior, ACs, and Planned migration/API tests in the corrective follow-up commit containing this row. | Addressed locally; re-review pending |
| 2026-09-18 | Chxtamos | PR #26 requested-changes review, Blocker 2 | Assignment and Administrator deactivation/demotion races lacked one lock/transaction protocol and final-state tests. | Added SERIALIZABLE User-before-Ticket locks, ascending ids, bounded 40001 retry, deterministic race outcomes, safe conflicts, and Planned database-state race tests in the corrective follow-up commit containing this row. | Addressed locally; re-review pending |
| 2026-09-18 | Chxtamos | PR #26 requested-changes review, Blocker 3 | Login could create a session without an exact Origin contract. | Added required exact Login Origin validation, ORIGIN_REQUIRED/ORIGIN_FORBIDDEN, no Referer/partial match, no rejected session, UI behavior, AC, and Planned tests in the corrective follow-up commit containing this row. | Addressed locally; re-review pending |
| 2026-09-18 | Chxtamos | PR #26 requested-changes review, Blocker 4 | Responsive evidence used width breakpoints instead of exact reproducible dimensions. | Separated CSS breakpoints from 390 x 844, 834 x 1112, 1440 x 900, and 200% zoom evidence; specified all six screens, exact paths/assertions, ACs, and Planned tests in the corrective follow-up commit containing this row. | Addressed locally; re-review pending |
